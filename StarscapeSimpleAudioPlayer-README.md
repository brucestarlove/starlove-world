This component requires **Howler.js** to function. Include it in your project:

```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/howler/2.2.4/howler.min.js"></script>
```

## Installation

1. Copy `StarscapeSimpleAudioPlayer.astro` to your components directory
2. Include Howler.js in your project
3. Import and use the component

## Basic Usage

### Astro Component

```astro
---
import StarscapeSimpleAudioPlayer from './components/StarscapeSimpleAudioPlayer.astro';
---

<!-- Basic usage with default playlist -->
<StarscapeSimpleAudioPlayer />

<!-- Custom playlist -->
<StarscapeSimpleAudioPlayer 
  playlist={[
    { title: "Track 1", src: "/audio/track1.mp3" },
    { title: "Track 2", src: "/audio/track2.mp3" }
  ]}
/>

<!-- With autoplay and custom volume -->
<StarscapeSimpleAudioPlayer 
  autoplay={true}
  volume={0.8}
  className="my-custom-player"
  id="my-unique-player"
/>
```

### React/Vue/Other Frameworks

For non-Astro projects, you can extract the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

```html
<!-- Include Howler.js -->
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/howler/2.2.4/howler.min.js"></script>

<!-- Audio Player HTML -->
<div class="starscape-audio-player" data-player-id="unique-player-id">
  <!-- Copy the HTML structure from StarscapeSimpleAudioPlayer.astro -->
</div>

<!-- Include the CSS and JS -->
<style>
  /* Copy CSS from StarscapeSimpleAudioPlayer.astro */
</style>

<script>
  // The component automatically initializes with proper state management
  // Each instance is isolated and handles navigation properly
</script>
```

## Props/Configuration

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `playlist` | `Array<{title: string, src: string}>` | Default tracks | Array of audio tracks |
| `autoplay` | `boolean` | `false` | Start playing automatically |
| `volume` | `number` | `1.0` | Initial volume (0.0 - 1.0) |
| `className` | `string` | `""` | Additional CSS classes |
| `id` | `string` | `"starscape-audio-player"` | Unique identifier for the player |

## Playlist Format

```typescript
interface Track {
  title: string;  // Display name for the track
  src: string;    // URL/path to audio file
}

const playlist: Track[] = [
  {
    title: "My Favorite Song",
    src: "/audio/favorite.mp3"
  },
  {
    title: "Another Great Track", 
    src: "https://example.com/audio/track.mp3"
  }
];
```

## Theming

The component uses CSS custom properties for easy theming:

```css
.starscape-audio-player {
  --secondary-bg: #1e293b;      /* Player background */
  --border-color: #334155;      /* Border color */
  --accent-bg: #3b82f6;         /* Accent/primary color */
  --glow-color: #60a5fa;        /* Hover accent color */
  --text-primary: #f1f5f9;      /* Primary text */
  --text-secondary: #e1e1e1;    /* Secondary text */
}

/* Dark theme example */
.dark-theme .starscape-audio-player {
  --secondary-bg: #111827;
  --border-color: #374151;
  --accent-bg: #3b82f6;
  --text-primary: #f9fafb;
  --text-secondary: #d1d5db;
}

/* Custom color scheme */
.custom-player {
  --accent-bg: #10b981;         /* Green accent */
  --glow-color: #34d399;        /* Light green hover */
}
```

## API Methods

Each player instance is self-contained and provides these methods:

```javascript
// Access a specific player instance (stored on the DOM element)
const playerElement = document.querySelector('[data-player-id="your-player-id"]');
const player = playerElement._starscapePlayer;

// Playback controls (if player exists)
if (player) {
  player.play();
  player.pause();
  player.togglePlayPause();
  player.next();
  player.prev();

  // Volume control
  player.setVolume(0.5); // Set to 50%

  // Track loading
  player.loadTrack(2); // Load track at index 2

  // Cleanup when done
  player.destroy();
}
```

## Events

The player automatically handles:
- Play/pause state changes
- Track progression
- Volume adjustments
- Progress tracking
- Error handling for missing files

## Persistence & Navigation

### Astro `transition:persist`

The component is optimized to work with Astro's `transition:persist` directive:

```astro
<!-- In your layout -->
<div class="taskbar" transition:persist>
  <StarscapeSimpleAudioPlayer 
    id="taskbar-audio-player" 
    playlists={audioPlaylists}
  />
</div>
```

**Benefits:**
- Audio continues playing across page navigation
- Playlist state is preserved
- Volume settings persist
- Current track position is maintained
- No audio interruption during navigation

**How it works:**
- The component detects when it's inside a persisted container
- Skips cleanup during navigation for persisted players
- Only cleans up non-persisted player instances
- Uses fixed IDs to maintain singleton behavior

## Browser Support

- **Modern browsers**: Full support
- **Mobile Safari**: Requires user interaction before audio can play
- **File formats**: Supports all formats that Howler.js supports (MP3, OGG, WAV, AAC, etc.)

## Responsive Behavior

- **Desktop**: Full controls with volume tooltip
- **Tablet**: Optimized spacing and sizing
- **Mobile**: Compact layout with adjusted font sizes

## Integration Examples

### Astro with TypeScript

```astro
---
import StarscapeSimpleAudioPlayer from '../components/StarscapeSimpleAudioPlayer.astro';

interface Track {
  title: string;
  src: string;
}

const myPlaylist: Track[] = [
  { title: "Ambient Loop", src: "/audio/ambient.wav" },
  { title: "Electronic Beat", src: "/audio/electronic.mp3" }
];
---

<main>
  <h1>My Music Player</h1>
  <StarscapeSimpleAudioPlayer 
    playlist={myPlaylist}
    volume={0.7}
    id="main-player"
  />
</main>
```

### React Integration

```jsx
import { useEffect } from 'react';

function MyAudioPlayer({ tracks, playerId }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    // The component handles its own initialization and cleanup
    // Just ensure Howler.js is loaded
    return () => {
      // Cleanup is handled automatically by the component
    };
  }, [tracks]);

  return (
    <div className="starscape-audio-player" data-player-id={playerId}>
      {/* HTML structure - component handles state management */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Howler.js not found"**: Ensure Howler.js is loaded before the audio player
2. **Audio won't play**: Modern browsers require user interaction before audio playback
3. **Styles not applying**: Check that CSS custom properties are defined
4. **Files not loading**: Verify audio file paths and CORS settings
5. **State persisting across pages**: Each player instance is now properly isolated
6. **Track index issues**: Fixed with proper state management and cleanup

### Debug Mode

Enable console logging by modifying the component:

```javascript
// Access player instance for debugging
const playerElement = document.querySelector('[data-player-id="your-id"]');
const player = playerElement?._starscapePlayer;

if (player) {
  console.log('Current track:', player.currentTrackIndex);
  console.log('Is playing:', player.isPlaying);
  console.log('Playlist:', player.playlist);
}
```

## Key Improvements in v2.0

- **Proper State Isolation**: Each player instance maintains its own state
- **Navigation Handling**: Automatic cleanup and reinitialization on page changes
- **Unique IDs**: Each player gets a unique identifier to prevent conflicts
- **Better Element Selection**: Uses data attributes instead of global IDs
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of audio resources and event listeners
- **Astro Integration**: Built-in support for Astro's client-side routing

## Key Improvements in v2.1 - Persistence Focus

- **Enhanced Persistence**: Simplified logic for `transition:persist` in Astro
- **Taskbar Integration**: Optimized for persisted taskbar audio players
- **Singleton Behavior**: Fixed singleton behavior across page navigation
- **Simplified Cleanup**: Removed complex detection logic, relies on Astro's built-in persistence
- **Fixed IDs**: Uses consistent player IDs instead of random generation
- **CSS Separation**: Removed duplicate CSS from Layout files, centralized in component

# TODO: export as package

Great question! Turning your `StarscapeSimpleAudioPlayer.astro` into a reusable package (npm package) allows you to easily share and install it in any Astro project. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide tailored for Astro components:

---

## 1. Create a New Package Directory

- Make a new directory for your package (outside your main project, or in a `packages/` folder if you want a monorepo).
  ```sh
  mkdir starscape-simple-audio-player
  cd starscape-simple-audio-player
  ```

---

## 2. Initialize the Package

- Run:
  ```sh
  npm init -y
  ```
- Edit the generated `package.json`:
  - Set a name (e.g., `"@your-username/starscape-simple-audio-player"`)
  - Set `"type": "module"`
  - Add a `"files"` field to include only the necessary files (e.g., `["dist", "README.md"]`).

---

## 3. Add Your Component and Assets

- Create a `src/` directory and copy `StarscapeSimpleAudioPlayer.astro` into it.
- Copy any required assets (CSS, utils, etc.) into `src/` or a `public/` folder as needed.
- Copy your README.

---

## 4. Prepare for Publishing

### a. Astro Component Packaging

Astro supports publishing components as packages. The most common approach is to:
- Place your `.astro` component(s) in `src/`
- Build to a `dist/` directory (optional for pure `.astro` components, but required if you have TypeScript or want to precompile)
- Export your component in an `index.js` or `index.mjs` file:

  ```js
  // index.js
  export { default as StarscapeSimpleAudioPlayer } from './src/StarscapeSimpleAudioPlayer.astro';
  ```

### b. Add a `README.md` and (optionally) a `LICENSE`

---

## 5. Handle Dependencies

- List any required npm packages in your `package.json` under `peerDependencies` (for packages the user must install) or `dependencies` (for packages bundled with yours).
- Example:
  ```json
  "peerDependencies": {
    "astro": "^4.0.0"
  }
  ```

---

## 6. (Optional) Build Step

If you use TypeScript or want to precompile, add a build script (e.g., using `astro build` or `tsc`).

---

## 7. Publish to npm

- Login to npm: `npm login`
- Publish: `npm publish --access public`

---

## 8. Usage in Another Project

- Install your package:
  ```sh
  npm install @your-username/starscape-simple-audio-player
  ```
- Import and use in Astro:
  ```astro
  ---
  import { StarscapeSimpleAudioPlayer } from '@your-username/starscape-simple-audio-player';
  ---
  <StarscapeSimpleAudioPlayer ...props />
  ```

---

## 9. Asset Handling

If your component uses static assets (audio, images), you have two options:
- **Bundle assets in the package:** Place them in a `public/` folder and document how users should copy them to their own `public/` directory.
- **Require users to provide assets:** Make asset paths props, so users supply their own.

---

## 10. Example Package Structure

```plaintext
starscape-simple-audio-player/
  package.json
  README.md
  LICENSE
  index.js
  src/
    StarscapeSimpleAudioPlayer.astro
    ...other utils or CSS
  public/
    ...optional assets
```
