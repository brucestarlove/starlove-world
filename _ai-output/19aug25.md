 I've successfully implemented the complete music section as requested. Here's what I've created:

  âœ… Music Section Complete!

  1. Updated Home Page Social Links

  - Replaced the multiple social links with a single music note icon
  - Links to /music page
  - Uses a clean music symbol (â™ª) instead of multiple social icons

  2. Created Main Music Page (/music)

  - Uses the same layout and styling as the About page
  - Features "Hip-Hop" section with "Hip-Hop Albums" link
  - Has the same fixed-size container layout
  - Includes the hero section with title "music & vibes"
  - Uses music note (â™ª) icons instead of stars for the list items

  3. Created Hip-Hop Albums Subpage (/music/hiphop-albums)

  - YouTube Embed: Features the specified video (ovQkVCCZ4VA starting at 51 seconds)
  - Full-width responsive: Video takes up the width of the container
  - Content Section: Placeholder div below the video for your future text content
  - Playlist Section: Styled playlist with placeholder items you can populate
  - Back Button: Links back to main music page
  - Consistent Styling: Matches the site's cyber theme

  4. Features

  - Responsive Design: Works on mobile and desktop
  - Consistent Theming: Uses your existing cyber color scheme
  - Navigation: Easy back/forth between music pages
  - Expandable Structure: Easy to add more music categories and subpages

  The structure is now ready for you to:
  - Add more music categories to the main music page
  - Fill in the content section with your descriptions
  - Add actual playlist items to replace the placeholder
  - Create additional music subpages following the same pattern

  The music note icons and orange color scheme (#ff6b35) give it a distinct musical feel while maintaining your site's aesthetic! ðŸŽµ
