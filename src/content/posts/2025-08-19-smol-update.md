# a smol update after some time

chose to live a lot of life for a couple weeks. including a long desired trip to the beach, to submerge in waves. my happy place.

today i described an aspect of my life as living so much in my wonderful imagination with no incentive to share it with others (was neither legacy nor money driven).

step by step im doin it. "lock in" is in the air.

which includes now prototyping out a SaaS to deliver nice community-centered platforms, starting with those intentional communities i've encountered

i spun up midjourney for a bit and spent 2x the time adding the gallery page on here. going to refactor to Next, automate some things, and add some real fun stuff with passcodes and tokens :)

random: i love archery. and pets.

be well,
bruce
