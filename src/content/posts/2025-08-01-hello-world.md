```bash
hello, world
```

listening to this as i post this website (Alison Wonderland's new 'iwannaliveinadream')

::video-youtube{#aCJ61Mzdw84}

here's a simple site to start. far from the vision of the worlds in my head. no overthinking, no perfectionism.

i've had several fun personal sites over my life. with more than 18 years of digital profiles..! and each reflected changes in me as a person. recently, i have wanted a new place to post my writings and promotions of other people, organizations, movements, ideas, etc. just a yearning of mine whenever i encounter something interesting and want to catalog & curate it for others to know.

i may write when i'm looking for help on a project or eyes on a thing. i may write intimate stories, website updates and uncontained creative inspiration. I'm kinda xploring how i want to show up on platforms like substack, while i improve my writing to reach a focus & quality for that and patreon and youtube & beyond. yes, i have chosen to write like this on this blog.

_[→ projects page -͟͟͞☆](/projects)_

this is my first project with `Astro` (rather than recent Next.js). chosen not for the name, although great and on-brand, but for this simple usecase.

most of my effort rn is on client projects and meeting people. i'm new to New York City, coming here on a whim! a story for another time. i'm enjoying it here a lot. i want to keep making connections, be them potential clients or collaborators or friends. i want to get out to the beach sometime. i want to listen to more live music and dance. i want to see, experience, love -- and keep building! prioritizing the former tbh while i have the opportunity, so all my extra projects including STARSCAPE APP will take longer than they could. for now.

yea i'm gonna keep this blog nice and simple and chill. i mean i'll talk about serious topics, and i do get mad at the wrong in the world but y'know i'm just a human sharing their perspective through a lens of wanting more love, peace, joy & abundance in the world. i spread that around to the few i encounter, and will try scaling my effectiveness up for the rest of my life.
