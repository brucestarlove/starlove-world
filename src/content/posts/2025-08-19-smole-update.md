# a smol update after some time

how funny i have big visions and deliver only little bit. today i described an aspect of my life as living so much in my wonderful imagination with no incentive to share it with others (was neither legacy nor money driven)

step by step im doin it

which includes now prototyping out a SaaS to deliver nice community-centered platforms, starting with those intentional communities i've encountered

i spun up midjourney for a bit and spent 2x the time adding the gallery page on here. going to refactor to Next, automate some things, and add some real fun stuff with passcodes and tokens :)

random: i love archery. and pets.

be well,
bruce
