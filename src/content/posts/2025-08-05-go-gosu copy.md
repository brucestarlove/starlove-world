# go gosu

::video-youtube{#pRSaSwbiMhE}

articulation and architectural familiarity are the differentiating skills. this project inadvertently served as a proof of my ability to articulate sweeping changes with its ability to refactor code. i did not use tailwindcss nor react in this project just to try something new. not super sure i can extend this website the way i want with Astro in the future...

final bit of site updates (not content): built out a starscape simple audio player that's now properly isolated like a package with full playlist support, added a slick radial navigation menu, expanded the art galleries and project showcases, tons of backend refactoring and architecture improvements. plus getting client work done on the side.

i am so grateful for these ai tools today. i am accelerating. i just need to keep learning and going.

if you have ever played RTS games, you understand agent coordination.

you now have agents at your fingertips which can affect the world.

your APM is as high as you can make it.

do you understand?
