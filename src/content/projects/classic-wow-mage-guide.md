# Classic WoW 2019 Mage Guide

_Early version of WoW Classic 2019 Mage guide_

A lil guide created for World of Warcraft Classic's launch in 2019, focusing on Mage strategies and optimization. The start of something that could've been great...

Built with Bootstrap CSS and custom styling to make it cute, flavorful, special.

I did have more than one person message me in-game throughout the years, telling me how they appreciated the website and videos--and wish I did more.

me too.

anyway if you dig a lil you can find a handful of clips from me playing this game, if you're into old school kind of vg clips.

this experience was something I genuinely desired for 8 years--I sent an email in 2011 asking for them to re-release the 2004-2007 version of the game, as I was playing fan-created private servers then. i went all-out. full-time for 2 years, i co-founded and co-led a guild that pushed to be the best from day one, managing teams, calculating & coordinating strategies, being an absolute "degenerate"--and having insane amounts of fun, bonding together through the COVID pandemic, and accomplishing very high achievements together. we represented US in a EU-dominated scene. i was mage class leader. and i got a guild atiesh :)
