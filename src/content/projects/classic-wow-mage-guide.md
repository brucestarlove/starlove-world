# Classic WoW 2019 Mage Guide

_Early version of WoW Classic 2019 Mage guide_

A lil guide created for World of Warcraft Classic's launch in 2019, focusing on Mage strategies and optimization. The start of something that could've been great...

Built with Bootstrap CSS and custom styling to make it cute, flavorful, special.

I did have more than one person message me in-game throughout the years, telling me how they appreciated the website and videos--and wish I did more.

Me too.
