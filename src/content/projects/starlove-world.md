# Starlove World

this site! yet another lil creative website. my real home base. "this time for sure." first time built with `Astro` -͟͟͞☆

it's also an art project, no?

## Features

- Dynamic theme switching (Cityscape, Forestscape, Starscape)
- Smooth page transitions
- Responsive design
- Blog functionality
- Project showcase
- Easter eggs

## Technologies Used

- **Astro** - Static site generator
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **CSS** - Custom styling with CSS variables (tested it after using tailwind--going back tailwind)

## Challenges & Solutions

Built this site to have a lowkey place to post project portfolio, various writings, videos, art concepts, announcements, promotions and signal-boosts; while creating a unique personal brand presence online (aka I'm just doing what I like)

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] a lot, maybe
