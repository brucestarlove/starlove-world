          October 2025: Currently Looking For Full-time Hire
        </h2>
        <p>
          Looking for full-time hybrid employment with a company that values
          initiative, creativity, growth and excellent user experience
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm a tech tinker, systems thinker, and creative technologist who has
          experimented a lot and now wants to join an existing company to grow
          and co-create bigger things. I still have much to learn, and desire to
          make greater impact expeditiously. I blend broad technical
          understanding with deep obsession, emotional intelligence, and a
          lifelong passion for understanding & solving problems.
        </p>

        <p>
          My background spans enterprise consulting, developer education,
          community organizing, and creative tech. I've led nonprofit web
          revamps, built community platforms from scratch, co-founded & managed
          student organizations (including my university's first hackathon,
          RAMHacks, 2014-2016), hosted dozens of webinars and interviews, and
          organized interdisciplinary symposia.
        </p>

        <p>
          I've recently been advising an early-stage startup and supporting
          small-org clients, while further developing my technical skills and
          prototyping several ambitious apps. I took a long sabbatical during
          the COVID-19 pandemic for health and exploration, while helping some
          small organizatons at-cost.

        <h2 class="section-title animate-title-delayed">Projects/Life Rant</h2>
        <p>
          i started coding in middle school ~2007 with myspace HTML+CSS layouts,
          if you could call it that. i went on to learn in class in high school,
          and took it from there on my own. i competed in coding & game-making
          competitions, founded multiple clubs, taught & tutored, participated
          in & managed hackathons, even made a lot of spreadsheets to min-max
          video games with my guilds.
        </p>
        <p>
          i have all sorts of projects tucked away on hard drives, online repos,
          long forgotten websites, or in forever lost videos & streams. i also
          did a lot of work through my enterprise consulting jobs, most of which
          is not saved to share and half of which was less creative,
          architecture & operations type of stuff. I frankly spent a lot of my
          other time minmaxing my life for fun, friends, events, random life
          adventures, and lots of games--most of which i'm honestly proud of and
          grateful for.
        </p>
        <p>
          i've always had a hyperactive imagination since as long as i can
          remember, filling notebooks with ideas of games, mods, apps, systems,
          educational & societal changes--a lot emerging nowadays, like
          particular kinds of online learning paradigms, new voting systems like
          liquid voting, AI for graphic & idea generation, AI for driving, and
          more. maybe because of video games, my deep interest in history &
          fantasy, and parents encouraging my expression.
        </p>
        <p>
          i do woe about the overwhelming number of ideas i never manifested. it
          was never a high priority for me, for whatever reasons. i had lots of
          opportunities early, from minecraft mods & servers to bitcoin to Big
          Tech jobs to game industry jobs to web3 industry jobs. i worked local,
          and was near friends and girlfriends. i was happy. i did also spend a
          very high number of hours learning & deeply researching all things
          related to geopolitics, from 2008 era onward, out of a since-9/11
          concern of what wild world i'm growing up in??
        </p>
        <p>
          tl;dr i want to craft, i want to be a positive influence in the world,
          and i want to enjoy my short life. meanwhile, ill keep improving &
          doing my best.
        </p>
        <!-- <p><strong>my goals right now</strong> are (1) to increase cash-flow through ever-better client work and digital sales (LOOKING FOR SMALL CONTRACT DEVS), (2) prototype apps to the point where i can pay engineers & co-create a better-built version for growth (LOOKING FOR CO-CREATORS), (3) scale up helping small businesses with student developers alongside a business partner (LOOKING).</p> -->
